Statistics & Analytics – BCA Notes

⸻

1. Introduction to Statistics

Definition:
Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data to make decisions.

Example:
A teacher calculates the average marks of students to understand class performance.

2. Sample vs. Population
Term	Meaning
Population	Entire group being studied (e.g., all students in a college)
Sample	A smaller group selected from the population (e.g., 50 students)

Example:
Surveying 100 people to understand the opinion of a city.

⸻

3. Measures of Central Tendency

These are values that represent the center of a data set.

a. Arithmetic Mean (Average)

Formula:
Mean = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values)

Example:
Marks = [50, 60, 70] → Mean = (50+60+70)/3 = 60

⸻

b. Harmonic Mean

Used when working with rates (speed, efficiency, etc.)

Formula:
H.M. = n / (1/x₁ + 1/x₂ + … + 1/xₙ)

Example:
Speeds = [60, 80] → H.M. ≈ 68.57 km/h

⸻

c. Geometric Mean

Used for growth rates (interest, population, etc.)

Formula:
G.M. = (x₁ × x₂ × … × xₙ)^(1/n)

Example:
Growth = [2, 8] → G.M. = √(2×8) = 4

⸻

d. Mode

Definition: Most frequently occurring value.

Example:
Marks = [70, 80, 80, 90] → Mode = 80

⸻

e. Quartiles

Definition: Divide the data into 4 equal parts.

Quartile	Meaning
Q1	25% of data (lower quartile)
Q2	50% of data (median)
Q3	75% of data (upper quartile)

Example:
Data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] → Q1 = 20, Q2 = 30, Q3 = 40

⸻

4. Variance & Standard Deviation

a. Variance

Tells how spread out the data is from the mean.

Formula:
Variance = Σ(x - mean)² / n

⸻

b. Standard Deviation

Square root of variance.
Low SD means values are close to mean.

Example:
Data = [2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9] → Mean = 5, SD ≈ 2

⸻

5. Outliers

Definition:
Values that are far from other values.

Example:
Marks = [45, 46, 50, 95] → 95 is an outlier.

⸻

Data Distributions

⸻

6. Normal Distribution (Bell Curve)

Shape: Symmetrical, bell-shaped curve
Example: Student heights in a classroom.

⸻

7. Uniform Distribution

Definition: All outcomes have equal probability.
Example: Rolling a fair die → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

⸻

8. Exponential Distribution

Definition: Measures time between events.
Example: Time until next customer arrives at a shop.

9. Right & Left Skewed Distributions

Type	Tail Direction	Example
Right Skewed	Tail on right	Income distribution
Left Skewed	Tail on left	Retirement age data

10. Random Distribution

Definition: No clear pattern or trend in data.
Example: Lottery number outcomes.

⸻

11. Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

Definition:
Even if population is not normal, the mean of many samples (n > 30) will be approximately normally distributed.

Importance:
Helps in predicting overall population behavior using samples.
