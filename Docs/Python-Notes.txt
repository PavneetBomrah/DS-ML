 PYTHON CONCEPTS + IBM EXAM QUESTIONS

⸻

1. Variables and Data Types

Concept:
Variables are used to store data. Python has dynamic typing.
Common data types: int, float, str, bool, list, tuple, dict, set.

x = 10        # int
pi = 3.14     # float
name = "IBM"  # str

IBM Questions:
	•	Q1. What is the output of type(3.14)?
→ <class 'float'>
	•	Q2. What data type is returned by input()?

⸻

2. Operators

Concept:
Python supports arithmetic (+, -, *, /), relational (==, !=, >, etc.), logical (and, or, not) and assignment operators.

a = 5
b = 2
print(a // b)  # Output: 2 (floor division)

IBM Questions:
	•	Q1. What is the output of 5 % 2?
→ 1
	•	Q2. Is and an arithmetic operator?
→ No, it’s logical.

⸻

3. Strings

Concept:
Strings are sequences of characters. Strings are immutable.

s = "IBM"
print(s.upper())  # Output: 'IBM'
print(s[0])       # Output: 'I'

IBM Questions:
	•	Q1. What will s[::-1] do?
→ Reverses the string.
	•	Q2. How to find the length of a string?
→ len(s)

⸻

4. Lists and Tuples

Concept:
	•	list is mutable, []
	•	tuple is immutable, ()

lst = [1, 2, 3]
lst.append(4)

tup = (1, 2, 3)

IBM Questions:
	•	Q1. What’s the difference between list and tuple?
	•	Q2. How to access last element in a list?
→ lst[-1]

⸻

5. Dictionaries

Concept:
Key-value pairs. Unordered.

d = {"name": "IBM", "course": "DS"}
print(d["name"])  # Output: IBM

IBM Questions:
	•	Q1. How to get all keys from a dictionary?
→ d.keys()
	•	Q2. Can dict have duplicate keys?
→ No

⸻

6. Conditional Statements

Concept:
if, elif, else

age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")

IBM Questions:
	•	Q1. What is the output if x = 5 and if x > 10:?
	•	Q2. Which keyword is used to check multiple conditions?

⸻

7. Loops (for, while)

Concept:

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count += 1

IBM Questions:
	•	Q1. What does range(1,5) return?
→ [1, 2, 3, 4]
	•	Q2. What loop is best for reading items in a list?

⸻

8. Functions

Concept:

def greet(name):
    return "Hello " + name

print(greet("IBM"))

def greet(name):
    return "Hello " + name

print(greet("IBM"))

IBM Questions:
	•	Q1. What is the default return type of a function without return?
→ None
	•	Q2. What is the use of def?

⸻

9. Lambda Functions

Concept:

square = lambda x: x**2
print(square(4))  # 16

IBM Questions:
	•	Q1. What’s the syntax for lambda?
	•	Q2. Can lambda have multiple expressions?
→ No

⸻

10. List Comprehension 

squares = [x*x for x in range(5)]

IBM Questions:
	•	Q1. Convert for loop into list comprehension.
	•	Q2. Which is faster – list comp or loop?

⸻

11. Exception Handling

try:
    print(10 / 0)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error")
finally:
    print("Done")

IBM Questions:
	•	Q1. What is the output of above?
	•	Q2. What is the use of finally block?

⸻

12. File Handling

f = open("test.txt", "r")
print(f.read())
f.close()

IBM Questions:
	•	Q1. How to read all lines?
→ readlines()
	•	Q2. What mode opens file for writing?
→ "w"

⸻

13. OOP (Classes and Objects)

class Car:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

c = Car("BMW")
print(c.name)

IBM Questions:
	•	Q1. What is __init__?
	•	Q2. How do you define a class?

⸻

14. Modules and Packages

import math
print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0

IBM Questions:
	•	Q1. What is a module?
	•	Q2. What does import do?

⸻

15. Working with NumPy (IBM Core)

import numpy as np
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(a.mean())

IBM Questions:
	•	Q1. How to create a 2D array?
	•	Q2. What function gives mean of array?
